//- this will simply generate a link to sort by name
//- note how we only have to pass the querystring param
//- that we want to modify here, not the entire querystring
a(href=paginate.href({ sort: 'name' })) Sort by name

//- this assumes you have `?age=1` or `?age=-1` in the querystring
//- so this will basically negate the value and give you
//- the opposite sorting order (desc with -1 or asc with 1)
//- a(href=paginate.href({ sort: req.query.age === '1' ? -1 : 1 })) Sort by age
